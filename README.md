# Date Nite Roulette

A planning app for choosing events and food for a night out.

## Description

When visiting the app, a random event will be generated (defaults to Seattle, WA) and it brings up a random restaurant within 2 kilometers of the picked event.  Users can select a date and/or location to narrow the field of search.  There are also checkboxes for defining search by event category and restaurant cuisine.

## Usage

This app uses two different APIs.  It pulls from Eventbrite API to select an event and populate information.  Restaurant information is searched and populated from Google Places API.
